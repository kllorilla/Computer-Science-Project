<h1>The Art Of Dance</h1>
<span><img src="images/homepage/mlue.gif" type="gif" alt="pubmat1" style="width:360px;height:280px;"></span>
<span><p>Dancing is so much more than just grooving on the dance floor to your favorite tunes. Dance is an art.
 This is because with dancing you are able to tell a story. Dance uses movement to convey the essence of human experience. 
 It's a lot more than fitness or entertainment. That movement of the body in a rhythmic manner, and the way you express your 
 idea and emotion tells so much. It is a powerful tool to communicate one's own beliefs, feelings, and expectations for the 
 life we live in and for the world we live in. Through your choreography especially the facial expressions, you can turn yourself 
 into another character entirely. Clearly, dance is a very unique activity, because it can be classified as both sport and art. 
 Yes! You heard it right, dance is a sport. Dancing has the same elements as any other sport. To be able to dance well, you need to 
 be agile, strong, have stamina, agility and, most importantly, enjoy what you do. As you can see, dance has all of the characteristics 
 and is just as challenging as any other activity. This means, that dance can also be considered as a sport. 
 Also, dancing is one way you can relieve stress and just be yourself.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Why Dance is Important?</h2>
<p>Dancing is important in many aspects. Not only does it train your brain and your body’s motor skills
but it also is an excellent exercise for your entire body. Dancing lets you remain physically and mentally fit. 
Perhaps more so, dancing on a regular basis will boost your overall well-being, enhance your self-esteem, 
strengthen your social skills as well as learning the value of discipline, commitment and work ethic.
Dance is not only a brilliant way to express yourself, but also a wonderful recreational activity that you can 
enjoy with your partner. Dancing will certainly improve your mood, help you forget all about yourself, 
and encourage you to get in touch with your partner. Dancing is a great way for many people to lose themselves 
in the vibrating rhythm of music. It allows them to forget about all the issues in their lives and simply enjoy 
the present moment. Happy? Dance. Sad? Dance. Angry? Dance. Let your body express what you are feeling. 
In all, dance is a perfect way to develop invaluable social skills. More importantly, though, it is an opportunity t
o teach your children the importance of being part of something greater than themselves. Dancers learn to turn around, 
to share their time, and to communicate with others while they function within a group. These life lessons are part 
of the attraction of dance classes to parents all over the world. Like team sports, children's dance will teach 
ome useful and important lessons.</p>

<br>
<h2>1. Practice.</h2>
<p>Practice is perfect when it comes to just about anything – especially dance. It is important to make a commitment to practice to optimize the effect of training. After all, practice is the only way to be professional. As performers, we need to welcome the discomfort of being beginners so that we can continue to learn and develop.</p>

<h2>2. Focus.</h2>
<p>Focus is the key to mastery and growth. Applied to dance, good concentration involves focusing on performance-relevant aspects of the attentional field. In other words, concentrating only on those things in the attentional field that are important for dancers to perform. By focusing on your goals during your practice, you'll be much more effective with your time and you'll learn a lot faster.</p>

<h2>3. Stretch Every Day.</h2>
<p>Regular Stretching helps to increase flexibility since the body is already warmed up and more pliable. This increase in flexibility helps in preventing tight muscles. The main aim in dancing is to make any step appear effortless. The more limber your legs are, the easier it is to lift them. Having tight muscles increases the risk of injury and can restrict you to execute your choreography. Make it a routine to stretch out every day.</p>

<h2>4. Wear Proper Attire.</h2>
<p>Each dance style requires specific types of clothes. You have to choose clothes that are suitable for your dance style and it should be comfortable . This is for you to execute your dance well and to make your movement much better. There are also specific dance shoes that you need. Dancing shoes are carefully structured to protect the legs and feet and to benefit the dancer. Make certain that you're dancing in the correct type of shoe and that the shoes are the right size.</p>

<h2>5. Listen To The Music And Find Your Rhythm.</h2>
<p>People dance because they're moved to dance with a beat or rhythm. At its most basic form, a dance might begin with a foot tap to a catchy rhythm,and taking the movement further, it becomes a dance.
You need to be able to feel the music and communicate the feeling through your body to be a good dancer. It 's important for a beginner to get acquainted with the rhythm, so get your hands on some music relevant to your chosen dance style and listen to it at any opportunity.</p>

<h2>6. Observe Other Dancers.</h2>
<p>There are many ways on how to observe other dancers. You could rent a couple of dance movies or instructional DVDs. Or when you are in a competition, you can monitor the other dancers closely. Observe things like body orientation, stance, and technique. Try to find ways to integrate the types you want into your own dance.</p>

<h2>7. Improve Your Technique.</h2>
<p>Using good technique in dancing is beneficial. In this way the dancer benefit from the use of correct technique, because it promotes high performance and reduces the risk of injury. Professional dancers have spent their entire careers perfecting their technique. Strong technique is what distinguishes the good dancers from the best ones. Learn new steps, but try to master the skills of each move.</p>

<h2>8. Look Up Not Down While You Dance.</h2>
<p>A common mistake made by inexperienced dancers is to look at your own feet while learning a new dance. It is very normal to want to do this, but it should be avoided. Dancing isn't about seeing, but it's about knowing and feeling. Instead of looking at your feet, try to recall how the steps feel, with the shifting of your weight to changes in direction registering in your head. This makes you recall the movements that make up the dance.</p>

<h2>9. Engage With The Audience.</h2>
Dancers' scores for both positive and negative emotions improved in the presence of the crowd. You can engage to your audience by eye contact. Even if you can't see every face in your crowd, you have to imagine and perform for that ideal human. Get in touch with your imaginary viewer and give him or her everything you have, show them that you are the best. Respond to the environment in the room. If the crowd is energized, ride the waves of electricity in the air to amp up the performance.</p>

<h2>10. Relax And Have Fun Dancing.</h2>
<p>Note, dancing is supposed to be enjoyable, not a chore or something to get worked up about. Dancing is supposed to help lower the blood pressure, not increase it, so don't be tough on yourself. No matter how many (or how few) dance moves you have in your sleeve, you can typically have a fun dance with everyone, given that you are always attentive to each other and at least give the impression that you enjoy yourself. Your body will dance its best when you're in a relaxed state. Take a few deep breaths and clear your mind. Relax your body with songs. Try using meditation before you start going .Relax and have some fun dancing.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Smile</h2>

<p>A smile is an expression of happiness, excitement, or amusement. If you smile as you dance, people can know that you enjoy and love what you do. Your smile also tells the judges and the audience that you are happy and that you truly enjoy the moment (whether you really feel that way or not). By concentrating on smiling before you head to the dance floor, this will help you loosen up some nerves and also generate positivity in you. Even if you dance on your own, smile to yourself. You love to dance, so let it show! 
You don't have to deal with any of these tips at once. Try working on one for a week or two, and when you've got that down, move on to the next — but keep integrating the ones you've learned. Don't let them slip by the side of the lane. When you bring it all together, you're going to be a star.</p>
