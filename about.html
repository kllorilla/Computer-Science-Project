<span><h1>Kyla Rose L. Lorilla</h1><h2>Author</h2><p>I am a fifteen-year-old student from Philippine Science High school. I am an experienced dancer 
and I am professionally taught. All my life, dancing has been my passion. It started when I was little, when dancing was my hobby, 
but now dancing is not just a hobby for me anymore. Dancing for me now, is more than that, it's my passion now. Up until today, 
I still showcase my talent in this field. My field of expertise is Dance Sports, specifically Latin Dance. I also do Hip-hop, Contemporary, 
Jazz, and Folk Dance. I also participated in many competitions which strengthened my skills. Dancing is my way of coping up from everything that is happening. 
It has been a safe haven for me ever since. Dancing gives me warmth and uplifts my soul. In dancing I am able to express my feelings. Dancing for me is Art, 
Passion and Freedom. I dance because this is my nature, this is the real me. In dancing, I showcase the real me. Dancing pretty much defines me as a person. 
hope that this passion of mine won't die and I will continue to be a dancer in the future.</p></span>
